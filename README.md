# ct_reconstruction
In this mini-project we will implement and test a reconstruction method with a regularisation term for 3D CT data of realistic size (ca. 750MB).

This repo includes a Solver class ``solver.py`` as well as a main notebook when we conducted our experiments ``main_solver.ipynb`` and finally ``lambda_tuning.ipynb`` where we experimented with different lambdas for reconstrucing the 3D CT data.
